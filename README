*** WARNING! This is beta software. It has not been fully tested and may
*** contain bugs. Use it at you own risk.

*** This tool must not be used to duplicate copyright-protected content.

Purpose
-------

This little tool will convert a CDI (DiscJuggler) image to NRG (Nero) format.
Both CDI 2.0 and 3.0 image versions are supported.

It currently has support for:

 - CD-ROM/XA type CDs
 - Mode 2 and Audio tracks
 - Single session and Multisession images

It lacks support for:

 - Audio-only CDs (TAO only)
 - Mode 1 data tracks

These will be added soon.


Usage
-----

Usage is very simple, just double-clic the executable file and an Open File
dialog will appear, select your source CDI image to convert and press OK.
A Save File dialog will then appear on the same path as source image. Write
the desired name for the destination NRG image (you don't need to write any
extension) and press OK. Default name is "image.nrg".

You can also use it from command-line. Syntax is:

cdi2nero image.cdi [image.nrg]

For command-line usage, if you don't specify a destination filename, the
source image filename will be used but with NRG extension.


Burning
-------

Once converted you can burn the newly created image. If a DAO warning message
appears, you should select Yes (although this depends on burner, I think).
This will only appear on Multisession images.


Notes
-----

This is a unified DAO/TAO version, unlike previous ones, where you can select
NRG image type when saving. DAO images are most standard ones, and is the only
format that Nero itself is able to generate. TAO images are special ones,
which lacks a cuesheet, and track positions are managed by the burner itself.
Nero is not capable of generating these. On most burners, these images will
be burned in "Track at Once" mode (hence the name) instead of default DAO.

A general note is to burn in DAO (default) mode and if something fails, try
TAO instead. But note that if your burner doesn't support "short" tracks (i.e.
those below 302 sectors) you still will get errors when trying to burn such
images. These errors are usually "cannot write track at correct position",
or seeing CD-Extra discs as Audio-only (i.e. no data track).

Below is a list of tested burners, reported by users, which get successful or
failed in burning process:

Success:

Acer CRW 6206A
BTC BCE-432IE
Gateway 8x4x32
HP CD-Writer 7100i
HP CD-Writer 7200e
HP CD-Writer 8100i
HP CD-Writer 9100i
HP CD-Writer 9310i
Iomega Zip CD 650
Iomega Zip CD USB (DAO only)
Memorex CRW-1622 (DAO only)
Mitsumi 4801TE
OTI-975 Socrates
Philips CDD3610
Philips CDD3801
Philips CDD4201
Philips PCRW404K
RICOH MP9060A
Sony CRX-140E
Teac CD-R56S
Yamaha 16x

Failure:

HP CD-Writer 7200i (*)
HP CD-Writer 8210e
HP CD-Writer 8250i (*)
Memorex tri-max 200
Mitsumi 4802TE
Mitsumi 4804TE
Sony CRX-100E
Sony CRX-120
Sony CRX-145E
TDK VeloCD 12x

(*) works with non-short tracks, patched or fixed images (tested)

Please note that these "problematic" burners mostly have "short" track
problems, and they should still work fine with non "short" track images. This
has not been tested, unless specified with (*).

You can identify "short" track type images with following CDIrip command-line:

cdirip image.cdi /info >info.txt

Open info.txt and search for tracks below 302 sectors in size, if any.

You can try to fix them with CDIfix before converting to NRG (only in case of
multiple audio track images).


That's all. Hope you like it!

Many thanks to xeal and myn, who have been excellent beta-testers!
